OVERALL RULES - Instead of writing large functions, create small functions that call their helpers. Place helpers after the main functions. However, don't
create helper functions for trivial one-liners. In Python, prefix helper function names with underscore.
- Document functions.
RULES FOR PYTHON CODE
- Always annotate function arguments and returned values with type hints.
- Use absolute, and not relative, imports.
- Prefer properly written data structures such as Pydantic models or enums to dicts and strings.
- Use Google-style docstrings, but don't provide type information in docstrings.
RULES FOR TYPESCRIPT CODE
- Prefer types over interfaces.
- Prefer function declarations over arrow functions.
